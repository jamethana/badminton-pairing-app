- Complex data type handling
- Error recovery

### 3. Components

#### 3.1 EmptyCourtModal (`src/components/EmptyCourtModal.test.js`)
**Status: ✅ PASSING**

Tests cover the court filling modal:
- **Rendering**: Warning messages for insufficient players, match preview
- **Player Assignment**: Initial team assignments and available pool
- **Player Swapping**: Within court and with available players
- **Match Confirmation**: Proper data structure and callback handling
- **Modal Behavior**: Click outside to close, proper event handling

**Key Test Scenarios:**
- Modal rendering for different player counts
- Player selection and swapping logic
- Match data generation and submission
- Modal interaction patterns

#### 3.2 CurrentMatches (`src/components/CurrentMatches.test.js`)
**Status: ✅ PASSING**

Tests cover the current matches display:
- **Court Rendering**: Occupied and empty courts
- **Modal Interactions**: Court options and empty court modals
- **Action Handling**: Match completion, court filling, court management
- **Data Display**: Player information, match statistics

**Key Test Scenarios:**
- Court state rendering
- Modal opening and closing
- Action callback handling
- Multiple court scenarios

#### 3.3 PlayerManagement (`src/components/PlayerManagement.test.js`)
**Status: ✅ PASSING**

Tests cover player management functionality:
- **Player Display**: Statistics, active/inactive states
- **Player Operations**: Add, edit, remove players
- **Form Handling**: Input validation, submission, clearing
- **Modal Management**: Edit modal opening/closing

**Key Test Scenarios:**
- Player statistics display
- Form submission and validation
- Player editing workflow
- Modal state management

#### 3.4 Notification (`src/components/Notification.test.js`)
**Status: ✅ PASSING**

Tests cover the notification system:
- **Notification Types**: Success, error, warning, info
- **Auto-dismissal**: 3-second timeout functionality
- **User Interaction**: Manual close buttons
- **Message Handling**: Various content types and lengths

**Key Test Scenarios:**
- Different notification types
- Auto-dismissal timing
- User interaction handling
- Content rendering

### 4. Main App Component (`src/App.test.js`)
**Status: ❌ FAILING** (Mock configuration issues)

Tests designed to cover the main application:
- **Component Rendering**: Main app structure and child components
- **State Management**: Player, match, and court state handling
- **User Actions**: Adding/removing players, managing courts
- **Notifications**: Success/error message display
- **Page Refresh**: Automatic refresh after certain actions

**Test Scenarios (when working):**
- App initialization and rendering
- Component interaction flows
- State update handling
- User action workflows

## Test Configuration

### Setup Files
- **`src/setupTests.js`**: Jest configuration with DOM matchers and browser API mocks
- **Mocking Strategy**: Comprehensive mocking of child components and external dependencies

### Testing Libraries
- **React Testing Library**: Component rendering and user interaction testing
- **Jest**: Test runner and assertion library
- **@testing-library/jest-dom**: Additional DOM matchers

## Test Statistics

- **Total Test Files**: 7
- **Passing Tests**: 69
- **Failing Tests**: 32 (all in App.test.js due to mock issues)
- **Test Coverage**: ~68% (excluding App component issues)

## Key Testing Patterns

### 1. Component Mocking
- Child components are mocked to isolate unit tests
- Mock components provide testable interfaces
- Props are validated through mock implementations

### 2. User Interaction Testing
- Click events, form submissions, keyboard input
- Modal opening/closing, overlay interactions
- State changes through user actions

### 3. Async Testing
- `waitFor` for asynchronous operations
- Timer mocking for auto-dismissal tests
- Promise resolution handling

### 4. Edge Case Coverage
- Empty data arrays
- Invalid input handling
- Error state management
- Boundary conditions

## Recommendations

### 1. Fix App Component Tests
The main App component tests are failing due to useLocalStorage mock configuration. Consider:
- Simplifying the mock implementation
- Using a different mocking strategy
- Testing App component integration separately

### 2. Add Integration Tests
Consider adding integration tests that test component interactions:
- Player management workflow
- Match creation and completion flow
- Court management operations

### 3. Performance Testing
Add tests for:
- Large dataset handling
- Memory usage optimization
- Render performance

### 4. Accessibility Testing
Enhance tests with:
- Screen reader compatibility
- Keyboard navigation
- ARIA attribute validation

## Running Tests

```bash
# Run all tests
npm test

# Run tests in watch mode
npm test -- --watch

# Run tests with coverage
npm test -- --coverage

# Run specific test file
npm test -- EmptyCourtModal.test.js
```

## Conclusion

The unit test suite provides comprehensive coverage of the application's core functionality. With 69 passing tests across utility functions, hooks, and components, the codebase demonstrates good testability and reliability. The main App component tests require mock configuration fixes to achieve full test coverage.

The testing approach follows React Testing Library best practices, focusing on user behavior and component integration rather than implementation details. This ensures that tests remain valuable even as the codebase evolves.
