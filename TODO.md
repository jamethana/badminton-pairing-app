# Badminton Pairing App - TODO List

## üéØ High Priority Features

### 1. Revamp ELO System
**Status**: Not Started  
**Priority**: High  
**Description**: Improve the current ELO calculation system to be more accurate and fair.

**Current Issues:**
- Simple +25/-23 point system doesn't account for skill differences
- No consideration of opponent skill levels
- Fixed point changes regardless of match difficulty

**Proposed Improvements:**
- **Skill-Based Calculations**: ELO changes based on opponent skill difference
- **Dynamic Point System**: Larger changes for upsets, smaller for expected outcomes
- **Team ELO Calculation**: For doubles matches, calculate team ELO vs individual
- **Confidence Intervals**: Account for player reliability (more matches = more stable ELO)
- **Calibration Matches**: Initial placement matches with higher ELO volatility

**Implementation Notes:**
- Research standard ELO formulas (chess, tennis, etc.)
- Consider Glicko or TrueSkill rating systems
- Add ELO calculation parameters to session settings

### 2. Add Smart Matching Toggle
**Status**: Not Started  
**Priority**: High  
**Description**: Add option to enable intelligent player matching based on skill levels.

**Current Behavior:**
- Random player selection for matches
- No consideration of skill balance
- Can result in very unbalanced games

**Proposed Smart Matching:**
- **Skill-Based Pairing**: Match players of similar ELO levels
- **Balanced Teams**: Create teams with similar combined ELO
- **Variety Control**: Prevent same partnerships repeatedly
- **Fairness Algorithm**: Ensure all players get fair matchups over time
- **Toggle Option**: Allow users to switch between random and smart matching

**Smart Matching Features:**
- **ELO Range Matching**: Keep players within ¬±50 ELO range when possible
- **Team Balance**: Ensure team total ELO is within ¬±25 points
- **Partnership Tracking**: Avoid repeating same partnerships too often
- **Opponent Variety**: Track who played against whom recently
- **Skill Development**: Occasionally pair lower/higher skill players for growth

**Implementation Notes:**
- Add toggle in session settings or match generation UI
- Create matching algorithms in GameService
- Track partnership and opponent history
- Add preference weights for different matching criteria
- Consider player availability and active status
